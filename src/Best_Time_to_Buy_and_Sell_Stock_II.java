 * 可以进行多次的股票交易
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
 * You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
 * However, you may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
